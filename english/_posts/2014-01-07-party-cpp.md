Originally established as the Marxist-Leninist Kampuchean People’s Revolutionary Party on June 28, 1951, the reformist Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) has ruled Cambodia since the Khmer Rouge regime fell  in January 1979. The CPP entered the first elections sponsored by the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia ([UNTAC](https://peacekeeping.un.org/mission/past/untacbackgr1.html)) in 1993, but lost to [FUNCINPEC](http://www.funcinpec.org), the royalist party. With King Norodom Sihanouk's intervention, FUNCINPEC and the CPP agreed to form a coalition government in 1993, and Hun Sen became the co-prime minister. Hun Sen became the president of the CPP in June 2015.
