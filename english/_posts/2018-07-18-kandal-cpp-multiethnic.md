$DATELINE$ Farmers here tend lush crops of mangoes, corn and chili peppers, just like anywhere else in Cambodia.
 
When they are not in their fields and orchards, they can usually be found buying groceries at the local general store, packing up their crops into bushels and boxes for export, drinking coffee and smoking at a favorite local cafe, and relaxing in hammocks strung beneath their stilted homes -- again, just like anywhere else.

But there is one key difference to this rural enclave. Here, the hammock-nappers fall asleep to the strains of Vietnamese pop songs. The farmers most often wear the conical bamboo hats favored in Vietnam. The snatches of conversation overheard at the coffee shop are frequently in Vietnamese. And many residents of Prek Chrey are not formally citizens of Cambodia, although some have lived here for decades.
 
These scenes reflect the complex history of this border region, which is separated from Vietnam’s An Giang province by nothing more than a narrow part of the Bassac River, muddy and cluttered with floating houses and fishing boats.
 
The issues of Vietnamese migration and alleged Vietnamese border encroachment have long been a potent political flashpoint in Cambodia. There are an estimated 500,000 Cambodians of Vietnamese descent, according to [a paper](http://www.institutesi.org/forum/workingpapers.php) published by the Institute on Statelessness and Inclusion, but many who would be eligible for citizenship continue to be denied documents due to poverty and prejudice. 
 
Opposition leader Sam Rainsy has for years accused the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen of turning a blind eye to Vietnamese migration and illegally issuing identity cards to these immigrants in order to garner more votes. Vietnamese migrants often favor the ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP). 
 
Because Hun Sen’s political career was born in 1979, when he was installed by the Vietnamese government as foreign minister of a caretaker regime after the fall of the Khmer Rouge, many Cambodians, fairly or not, suspect his government of being in thrall to Hanoi. 
 
In turn, Hun Sen’s government and some human rights groups, including the Cambodian Center for Human Rights, have accused Sam Rainsy of spreading anti-Vietnamese bias and stoking racism in exchange for votes.
 
Sam Rainsy has been convicted of multiple crimes, including defamation, incitement and map defacement, for his efforts over the years to prove that the CPP has carelessly allowed swaths of land along the border to be swallowed up by Vietnam. One [lawmaker](https://www.voanews.com/a/cambodia-opposition-lawmaker-arrest-border-comments/3280305.html) and one senator from the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), which Sam Rainsy co-founded, were [jailed over similar claims](https://www.voanews.com/a/cambodian-senators-gets-7-year-sentence-for-facebook-post/3584325.html).

Here on the ground in Prek Chrey, the issues seems less fraught. When VOA journalists visited the commune, its many ethnic Vietnamese residents seemed to be living peacefully alongside Cambodians, despite a traditional mistrust born of long-ago battles. Farmers and fishermen do a bustling trade with their counterparts across the Bassac.

%}“There are not any problems between Cambodians and Vietnamese living here,” said Chab Suy, the longtime CPP commune chief. “They do business together.”
 
His own stilted wooden house is located in an almost entirely non-Khmer neighborhood near the Bassac River, with a jumble of makeshift shacks occupied by ethnic Vietnamese leading down to the water.
 
Still, voter data from recent commune elections tells a more complicated story -- of discrimination on the one hand, and potentially illegal mass registration on the other. 
 
Voter turnout in Prek Chrey dropped about 35 percent from <a href="#june_2012" class="trigger__factbox">2012</a> to <a href="#june_2017" class="trigger__factbox">2017</a>, from 5,218 to 1,835, although the population of the commune has stayed relatively stable.
 
Although Chab Suy declined to discuss this discrepancy in detail, he said it was likely due to last year’s nationwide effort to purge the voter list of ineligible voters, including Vietnamese migrants without proper papers.
 
This would mean that the majority of those voting in Prek Chrey up until 2017 did not have legal documents to be in Cambodia. 
 
“Some voters were removed because there was a new reform,” Chab Suy said.

Say Lork, a CNRP official in Koh Thom district until the opposition party was dissolved in November by a Supreme Court order, was more forceful, insisting that there was a serious problem with Vietnamese migration in Prek Chrey commune.
 
“Less than 30 percent are Cambodians,” he said of the commune’s population.
 
“Villagers also complained that Vietnamese can cross to Cambodia to do business, but Cambodians can’t do the same,” he added. “It is not balanced.”
 
In addition to being purged from the voter list, ethnic Vietnamese have been targeted in a campaign that began late last year to identify “improper” citizens and revoke their documentation. 
 
Although the Interior Ministry said in February that it would create a new program to provide official residency cards to these people, advocates said that many of those targeted by the program should already be entitled to formal citizenship.  
 
One person affected by these changes is Som Sok, who identifies as a mixed-race Vietnamese-Cambodian and was born to a Cambodian father and a Vietnamese mother. He runs a bustling coffee shop where, one recent morning, men packed up goods for trading across the border, while women wheeled their bicycles back and forth selling snacks like mangoes and hard-boiled eggs.

Sok, a father of three in his early 60s, was born in this area, but along with many Vietnamese-speaking Cambodians, managed to flee the Khmer Rouge soon after they came to power in <a href="#april_17_1975" class="trigger__factbox">1975</a> by crossing the border into Vietnam. 
 
When they returned to their home country after the fall of the Pol Pot regime in <a href="#jan_7_1979" class="trigger__factbox">1979</a>, many were without identity documents due to the confusion of war, and they were considered foreign citizens.
 
Sok returned to this area in 1980, married a Vietnamese woman, and started his business. He said he had voted without any trouble since the first post-conflict elections in 1993, but last year his citizenship status was questioned and he was removed from the list.
 
“I don’t have my name in for this year’s election,” he said in fluent Khmer.
 
In a paper published in January in the journal Political Geography, the researchers Laurie Parsons and Sabina Lawreniuk found that Cambodian officials often denied documentation to ethnic Vietnamese people based on their ethnicity alone and perceived foreignness, rather than an examination of whether they actually qualified for the papers.
 
“The result is constitutionally embedded exclusion for many ethnic minorities, but in particular the Vietnamese, who continue to be viewed as the object of historical animosity,” they [wrote](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629817300690).

This lack of documentation makes ethnic Vietnamese people in Cambodia effectively stateless, raising their risk of suffering from social and environmental problems -- as well as making them more vulnerable to government pressure of all sorts. It also makes it increasingly difficult to differentiate between longtime residents of Cambodia, who are often entitled to formal citizenship, and recent migrants.
 
The ex-CNRP official, Say Lork, cited this as a problem.
 
“We want them to live here legally, not just [as] immigrants who are not eligible to vote,” he said, adding that the government’s documentation drive did not seem to have improved the situation, although the voter list had been cleaned up.
 
When the results from the <a href="#june_2017" class="trigger__factbox">2017</a> elections were in, all 11 communes in Koh Thom district except Prek Chrey were found to have swung to the opposition CNRP.
 
“In places where there are a lot of Vietnamese, the CPP always wins,” Say Lork said in frustration.
 
However, Prek Chrey commune chief Chab Suy is quick to proclaim his party’s excellence, and attributes his win to the CPP’s good governance over the years -- not the ethnic makeup of his commune.  
 
Citing one of the CPP’s favorite maxims, he called it “the party that saves lives,” and said Cambodians owed the ruling party a debt of gratitude for joining with Vietnam to overthrow the Khmer Rouge in 1979, adding, “the party liberated people.”
