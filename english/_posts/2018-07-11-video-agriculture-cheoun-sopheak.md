Political foes of the ruling Cambodian People’s Party were wiped out of the battlefield ahead of July 29 national election, when Cambodia’s Supreme Court dissolved the only viable opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party in last November. Despite the absence of CNRP in the elections, political tension in the country continues, when the opposition has called for election boycott.
