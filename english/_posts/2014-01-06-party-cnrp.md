The Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) was founded on July 17, 2012 when Kem Sokha’s Human Rights Party (HRP) and Sam Rainsy’s Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) merged. Sam Rainsy, a former finance minister who founded an opposition party in 1995,  was  president and Kem Sokha, long a voice for political rights, as well as social and economic development, at village level, was the vice president. 

The CNRP entered its first elections in 2013, and won 55 seats of the 123 places in the National Assembly. 

On February 11, 2017, Sam Rainsy, the self-exiled president of the CNRP, resigned from his post in an attempt to save the party from dissolution after Hun Sen threatened to change the law to enable the government to dissolve parties whose officials had committed criminal offenses. Sam Rainsy had been [convicted in absentia](https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/rainsy-exile-order-lifted-ex-cnrp-leader-hints-his-return-dependent-pardon)

In March 2017, Kem Sokha succeeded Sam Rainsy as the CNRP president. On September 3, 2017, Kem Sokha was arrested at his home in Phnom Penh for alleged treason, accused by the government of conspiring with the United States to bring down the Cambodian government.

On November 16, 2017, Cambodia's Supreme Court [ordered the dissolution](https://www.voanews.com/a/cambodia-supreme-court-dissolves-cnrp/4117996.html) of the CNRP. Some opposition members joined the CPP, while many fled the country or were forced out of politics.
