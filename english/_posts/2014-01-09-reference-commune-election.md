As Cambodia stabilized and focused on institution building, it launched commune elections in 2002. Communes are the most local of administrative bodies, overseeing all the villages and their residents in a given area.
 
Commune elections are held every five years, and the political party that wins the majority selects the commune chief in that commune. 
 
Commune chiefs work closely with the district governors addressing local issues such as sewage, roads, crimes, clean water, and electricity. The ruling Cambodian Peopleâ€™s Party (CPP) has occupied most of the commune seats nationwide since 2002.
