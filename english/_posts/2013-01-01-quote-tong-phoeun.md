“I voted for the Sam Rainsy Party. I am going to vote this year, when I am asked to. I don't know which party to vote for this time. Nothing has changed although I voted differently. I didn't know that [the CNRP] was dissolved. I heard Prime Minister Hun Sen said, "If there is Sy [Sam Rainsy], there will be no Sen [Hun Sen].”
