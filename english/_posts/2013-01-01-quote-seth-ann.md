“I am grateful for the Cambodian People's Party that saved my life [from war]. I will never forget it until the day I die. I am going to vote this year. I never skip voting. If there is another party leading the country, I think it is good, too. Samdech (Hun Sen) has led the country for a long time, and I want to see how a new party can improve the country.”
