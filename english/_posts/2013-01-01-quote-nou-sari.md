“I voted for Prime Minister Hun Sen. I just followed other people who voted for him. When I saw other people pick the party [on their ballot], I just followed them. If I don’t vote, I am afraid there is a problem since the community leaders normally ask everyone to go to vote. We are not the citizen if we don’t vote. But I am not afraid [to not vote for CPP.] We should not be scared, because it is our right to vote.”
