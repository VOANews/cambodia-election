Born on January 2, 1944, in Phnom Penh, Prince Norodom Ranariddh is the eldest son of the late King Norodom Sihanouk and a longtime political player, although he has never managed to regain the power he wielded in the mid-1990s as a co-prime minister with Hun Sen. He received a Ph.D. in law from the University of Aix-en-Provence in France, and taught sociology and constitutional law at the university from 1976 to 1983. He left that position to become more closely involved in Cambodian politics.

Norodom Ranariddh became the president of the royalist FUNCINPEC party in 1991. The party won a near-majority 58 of 120 parliamentary seats in the general elections in <a href="#may_23-28_1993" class="trigger__factbox">1993</a>, the first election since the end of the Khmer Rouge regime, which ruled from <a href="#jan_7_1979" class="trigger__factbox">1975 to 1979</a>. However, when Hun Sen’s Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) refused to cede power, Norodom Ranariddh was forced to enter into a power-sharing agreement with Hun Sen as co-prime minister. 

Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen were not able to come to an agreement on many issues, including public policy and development projects. Finally, in <a href="#july_1997" class="trigger__factbox">July 1997</a>, Norodom Ranariddh was forced into exile after a major clash between troops loyal to the two prime ministers. He was ousted from his position a month later. 

Norodom Ranariddh returned to Cambodia in <a href="#march_1998" class="trigger__factbox">March 1998</a>, and was appointed as the president of the National Assembly in November after his party lost the general elections to the CPP in <a href="#july_26_1998" class="trigger__factbox">July</a>. It was widely speculated that he was angling to be the next king of Cambodia, but he publicly announced in 2001 that he had no interest in succeeding his father. 

In <a href="#march_2006" class="trigger__factbox">March 2006</a>, Norodom Ranariddh resigned from his National Assembly presidency, and in <a href="#oct_2006" class="trigger__factbox">October</a> of that year, he was ousted from FUNCINPEC. Since then, he has cycled in and out of politics, founding his own Norodom Ranariddh Party and then heading a new group he called the Community of Royalist People Party, until in January 2015 he returned to FUNCINPEC and was reappointed as the president of the party. FUNCINPEC did not win any seats in the national elections in 2013, but the party now has 41 seats in the National Assembly after Cambodia’s Supreme Court dissolved the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) in November 2017 and its parliamentary seats were redistributed.
