Sam Rainsy was born on March 10, 1949, into an elite family in Phnom Penh. He received a master’s degree in business administration in 1980 from France’s INSEAD, one of the world’s top business schools, then worked as a banker before opening his own accounting firm. 

His father, Sam Sary, was a deputy prime minister for King Norodom Sihanouk and served as Cambodia’s ambassador to England in the 1950s, although he was recalled after a scandal involving the physical abuse of his maid. In 1965, Sam Rainsy’s family fled Cambodia for France after his father disappeared in 1962. Sihanouk had declared Sam Sary persona non grata over an alleged coup plot. It is believed that Sam Sary was put to death. 

In 1989, Sam Rainsy joined Prince Norodom Ranariddh’s royalist FUNCINPEC party, and became a European representative of the prince. He then returned to Cambodia, and became a member of parliament representing Siem Reap province, also serving as Finance Minister from September 1993 to October 1994 before being stripped of his portfolio and expelled from the FUNCINPEC due to his vociferous complaints about corruption. 

He founded his own political party, the Khmer Nation Party (KNP) in <a href="#1995" class="trigger__factbox">1995</a>. In 1997, he narrowly escaped with his life after a grenade attack at one of his party rallies killed at least 16 supporters and injured approximately 120. He renamed his party, and the newly minted Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) won 15 seats in the National Assembly in the <a href="#july_26_1998" class="trigger__factbox">1998</a> national elections. In the <a href="#july_27_2003" class="trigger__factbox">2003</a> elections, the SRP won 22 percent of the votes, becoming the second most popular party in the country after Hun Sen’s Cambodian People’s Party (CPP).

Throughout the <a href="#feb_2006" class="trigger__factbox">2000s</a>, Sam Rainsy spent substantial portions of time outside Cambodia after being forced to flee twice due to a raft of legal cases against him, which were widely seen as politically motivated. In <a href="#july_17_2012" class="trigger__factbox">2012</a>, while still outside Cambodia, Sam Rainsy joined forces with the Human Rights Party (HRP), led by Kem Sokha, to form a new opposition party, the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), with Rainsy as president and Sokha as vice president. At Hun Sen’s request, King Norodom Sihamoni pardoned Sam Rainsy, and he returned to Cambodia on <a href="#july_2013" class="trigger__factbox">July 19, 2013</a>, days ahead of the national elections. 

The CNRP won 55 of 123 National Assembly seats in the national elections on <a href="#july_28_2013" class="trigger__factbox">July 28, 2013</a>. However, alleging that Hun Sen’s ruling party CPP manipulated the election results to eke out a win, Sam Rainsy led his party in an effort to boycott the parliament. In <a href="#july_22_2014" class="trigger__factbox">2014</a>, the CNRP reached an agreement with the CPP and joined the parliament, with Sam Rainsy serving as minority leader. However, the rapprochement proved short-lived. Since <a href="#nov_16_2015" class="trigger__factbox">2015</a>, Sam Rainsy has lived in self-imposed exile after being charged in defamation cases. 

In <a href="#feb_11_2017" class="trigger__factbox">February 2017</a>, Sam Rainsy resigned from the CNRP to head off the prospect of the party’s dissolution. Still in exile today, Sam Rainsy remains an outspoken critic of Hun Sen and has been attempting to promote democracy from abroad under the auspices of a new group, the Cambodia National Rescue Movement (CNRM).
