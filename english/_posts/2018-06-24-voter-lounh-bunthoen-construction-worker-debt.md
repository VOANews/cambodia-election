$DATELINE$ Every Saturday evening, Lounh Bunthoeun jumps on his motorbike to make the two-hour journey to Takeo province to see his family.
 
Like many rural Cambodians, he moved to the capital for a job in the country’s booming construction sector. From dawn until dusk, Lounh Bunthoeun, 47, works in construction on Phnom Penh’s Diamond Island, an artificial island that’s a mixed bag of glitzy hotels, posh restaurants, nightclubs, company headquarters and conference centers.

It stands as a testament to Cambodia’s socioeconomic divide between those who have funds to enjoy the high life and those like Lounh Bunthoeun who each week leaves the island with $37 in wages, worrying about how he can repay loans he took out to better his family’s life.
 
Lounh Bunthoeun’s work schedule is not going to change any time soon. He must pay off those debts that began accumulating in 1996 when he took out a loan to cover the purchase of two cows that he and his wife Cheam Sokly planned to breed for profit.
 
But since last year, a widespread crackdown on political opposition and civil society by the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen has seen [calls for increased sanctions against Cambodia](https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/eu-review-cambodias-eba-status). Just the thought of sanctions upends Lounh Bunthoeun, whose family and future depend on paying off those cows as planned.
 
The [United States is considering a bill](https://www.voacambodia.com/a/us-senators-propose-cambodia-sanctions-bill/4256301.html) that could place economic sanctions on Cambodia’s leaders and their families because they indirectly control and benefit from most of the nation’s industries and services.
 
The European Union (EU) is considering rescinding Cambodia’s preferential import status. Given that in 2016, Cambodia’s global garment exports were worth $6.3 billion and they reached $4.9 billion in the first seven months of 2017, [according to the Garment Manufacturers Association](https://www.reuters.com/article/cambodia-garments/cambodias-garment-export-growth-expected-to-slow-next-year-manufacturers-group-idUSL3N1O82N3). Losing duty-free access to the EU would be a blow to Cambodia, which is among the world’s top garment-making hubs and sends about 30 percent of its exports to the European Union.

“We are in debt,” Lounh Bunthoeun told VOA Khmer, and repayment is a family affair. Cheam Sokly and the couple’s younger daughter, works in a garment factory. Together, they repay about $370 a month with interest microfinance institutions. Their current combined household monthly income is $380 before any overtime pay.
 
If the family misses three consecutive loan payments, their home and land could be confiscated by the lenders. This explains why the specter of sanctions, which might cause a dip in the household’s income, causes so much apprehension.
 
Lounh Bunthoeun and his wife, Cheam Sokly are not alone in their debt worries. Some 1.8 million Cambodian households have turned to largely unregulated microfinance institutions and non-governmental organizations to borrow, on average, $1,500 each ([PDF](https://www.nbc.org.kh/download_files/publication/eco_mon_sta_eng/Review%20291%20Jan%20En.pdf)). Rural families carry about 80 percent of the loans, which can come with annual interest rates as high as 30 percent.




### Road to debt ###



How Lounh Bunthoeun and Cheam Sokly became debtors illustrates the difficulty of transitioning from rice farming on a small holding to feed the family to market farming to earn money.

When they married in 1993, Lounh Bunthoeun and Cheam Sokly as a couple wove houl, the Cambodian silk fabric used for weddings and Buddhist ceremonies. In their home workshop in the Prey Kabas district’s Tang Yap commune, once they purchased the silk threads, they controlled production — hand-dying the thread, then weaving it into the traditional Khmer uneven twill patterns, an expensive process.

As Cambodians opted for cheap imported houl from Thailand and Vietnam, and the market for the couple’s pricey traditional houl contracted, Lounh Bunthoeun took a salaried job so he could continue to support the couple’s three children and aging parents, and Cheam Sokly found a job in a shoe factory.

Family expenses outpaced their wages. They sold the land used for growing rice and tapped into their savings only to find themselves “in debt to the middlemen who actually bought our houl,” said Lounh Bunthoeun. The middlemen, who controlled the price, sought out traditional craftspeople, bought their output and sold it in tourist gift shops in Phnom Penh, outlets few rural people approached.

In 1996, Lounh Bunthoeun decided to use the couple’s remaining land in Takéo province as collateral for a $200 loan from ACLEDA Bank, Cambodia’s first commercial bank. That bought two cows, which the couple planned to breed and sell the calves for profit. And it put their house, built on the land used for collateral, at risk.

Lacking any financial education, the couple failed to take into account the interest they needed to pay on the loan. To bring in more money, the younger daughter left school when she was 17 to work in a factory, where Cheam Sokly soon joined her.

After establishing their cattle-breeding enterprise and taking salaried jobs, the family found they had access to more credit. They took out a $2,000 loan to renovate their home. They took out a $2,000 loan to install a working toilet system. They took out a $4,000 loan to build a kitchen. At no point could Lounh Bunthoeun tell VOA the interest rate, or how much the money cost to borrow.

In March 2017, the government ordered microfinance lenders to implement an [18 percent interest cap](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics-Economy/Economy/Interest-rate-cap-rattles-Cambodia-s-microfinance-industry?page=1), effective April 2017. The [move](https://www.cambodiadaily.com/news/will-move-to-cap-microfinance-interest-rates-backfire-on-cpp-126564/) came before the local commune elections in June, and many saw it as appeal by the ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) to the rural voters who are its mainstay even as the National Bank of Cambodia warned ([PDF](https://www.nbc.org.kh/download_files/research_papers/english/8074InterestRateUnderstandingand-PossibleDistortionsofInterestRateCapinCambodia.pdf)) that the policy could result in lenders “refusing to provide credit to the poor.”

### Uncertain future ###



A year later, Lounh Bunthoeun remains in Phnom Penh throughout the week. He budgets about 38 cents for lunch and the same for dinner, meals that usually don't “taste that good.”

Working away from home has taken a toll but he says the loans have been put to good use.

“I think [about the debt] a lot,” Lounh Bunthoeun says because he knows he could lose that land originally used as collateral. “My wife thinks [about it] a lot.”

“She has insomnia,” he says. “How I deal with it is that I hang out with some guys here, drinking some beers and then I sleep fine.”

Lounh Bunthoeun says the loans have afforded the family an unprecedented standard of living, and Srey Neat, their eldest daughter, is now a sophomore majoring in social science at the Royal University of Phnom Penh. “I live for the future of my children and hope to bring betterment to my family in the long run,” said Lounh Bunthoeun.

That her younger sister quit school to enter the workforce saddens Srey Neat, who says she’s ready to follow her into the workforce “if my parents lost their jobs.”

Cheam Sokly hopes that the family’s time apart will be “over soon.” Once the debt “is paid off, I hope to quit factory work and return to the silk-weaving business. It’s been our family’s way of life since I was a teenager.”
