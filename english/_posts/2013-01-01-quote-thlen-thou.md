“Many support the Cambodian People's Party. People hate that [the oppoition CNRP was elected], so now [commune leadership] is given to CPP. I went to vote [last year] at Koh Teav pagoda. I am not sure if I will vote [this year]. I continue to observe the situation. If it is stable, I will go to vote. If not, I am not going to vote. It is normal for people to vote for whoever they like. It is not like you are holding people's hands to vote for you.”
