name="Norodom Sihanouk"
cutline="1941" 

%} Born on October 31, 1922, King Norodom Sihanouk was the grandson of King Sisowath Monivong, who reigned from 1927-1941. King Sihanouk was 18 years old when he succeeded King Monivong and Cambodia was still a French colony. Although France anointed Sihanouk for the position, in part because Paris thought he would be politically tractable, Sihanouk successfully achieved Cambodia’s independence from France in <a href="#nov_9_1953" class="trigger__factbox">1953</a>, and the country became the Kingdom of Cambodia. In <a href="#sept_1955" class="trigger__factbox">1955</a>, he founded his own political party, the Sangkum Reastr Niyum, or the “People’s Socialist Community.” That same year, King Sihanouk abdicated in favor of his father, Suramarit, and became the prime minister. After his father died in <a href="#april_1960" class="trigger__factbox">1960</a>, Sihanouk became the head of state.

U.S.-backed Gen. Lon Nol led a coup in <a href="#march_1970" class="trigger__factbox">March 1970</a>, overthrowing Sihanouk while he was in Moscow. Sihanouk took refuge in Beijing until <a href="#april_17_1975" class="trigger__factbox">1975</a>, when Khmer Rouge guerrillas leading a resistance movement against Lon Nol’s Khmer Republic captured Phnom Penh on April 17 and took over the country. Sihanouk initially supported the Khmer Rouge regime and was installed as head of state by the communists, but resigned in 1976 as his relationship with them declined rapidly. He spent the rest of the regime as a de facto prisoner of the Khmer Rouge, who wreaked havoc on the country, killing or starving to death an estimated 1.7 million people from <a href="#april_17_1975" class="trigger__factbox">1975 to 1979</a>.

Sihanouk continued to play a key role in Cambodian politics after Vietnam invaded Cambodia and overthrew the Khmer Rouge regime in <a href="#jan_7_1979" class="trigger__factbox">1979</a>. He played [a leading role](https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national-post-depth-politics/well-always-have-paris-peace-accords-25-years-later) in negotiating the Paris Peace Accords in 1991. Although the 1993 constitution prohibits the royal family from direct involvement in political affairs, Sihanouk remained influential and was an enduring symbol of Cambodia until his death on <a href="#oct_15_2012" class="trigger__factbox">October 15, 2012</a>.
