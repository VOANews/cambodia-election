Cambodia achieved independence from French colonial rule in 1953. Since then, a series of governments have come and gone. The figure who has remained in the spotlight longest, Hun Sen, began his political career in 1979, when he was appointed foreign minister by the Vietnamese, who defeated the Khmer Rouge regime that lasted from 1975-1979. Hun Sen became prime minister in 1985, and remained in office since then. Now 67, he has vowed to stay in power for another decade.
